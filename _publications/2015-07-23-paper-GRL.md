## Abstract
A method for combining two microwave satellite soil moisture products by maximizing the temporal correlation with a reference data set has been developed. The method was applied to two global soil moisture data sets, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), retrieved from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 observations for the period 2012?2014. A global comparison revealed superior results of the combined product compared to the individual products against the reference data set of ERA?Interim volumetric water content. The global mean temporal correlation coefficient of the combined product with this reference was 0.52 which outperforms the individual JAXA (0.35) as well as the LPRM (0.45) product. Additionally, the performance was evaluated against in situ observations from the International Soil Moisture Network. The combined data set showed a significant improvement in temporal correlation coefficients in the validation compared to JAXA and minor improvements for the LPRM product.
